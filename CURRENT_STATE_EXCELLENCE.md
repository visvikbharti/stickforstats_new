## 🎉 WHAT'S WORKING BRILLIANTLY

### 1. **Cosmic Landing Page** ✨
- **Status:** STUNNING SUCCESS
- **Features Working:**
  - Golden ratio spiral animation (φ = 1.618...)
  - 200 animated stars
  - Floating mathematical constants (π, e, √2, ∞)
  - Golden particles system
  - Typewriter welcome effect
  - Smooth 1.618-second transitions
- **Impact:** Creates unforgettable first impression

### 2. **Guardian System** 🛡️
- **Status:** FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Capabilities Confirmed:**
  - ✅ Detects normality violations (Shapiro-Wilk)
  - ✅ Identifies outliers (IQR + Z-score)
  - ✅ Checks variance homogeneity (Levene's test)
  - ✅ Tests independence (autocorrelation)
  - ✅ Detects multimodality (KDE peaks)
  - ✅ Validates sample size (golden ratio thresholds)
- **Real Test Results:**
  ```json
  Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2,100] vs [5,5,6,6,7,7,8]
  Result: "Critical violations detected"
  Alternatives: ["mann_whitney", "permutation_test", "bootstrap"]
  Confidence: 0.345 (correctly low!)
  ```

### 3. **50-Decimal Precision Engine** 🎯
- **Status:** WORKING PERFECTLY
- **Example Output:**
  ```
  t_statistic: "-8.1514039933355209526495318820288138166634561559370"
  (That's 50 decimals of precision!)
  ```
- **Modules with 50-Decimal:**
  - ✅ T-Test (all variants)
  - ✅ ANOVA
  - ✅ Correlation
  - ✅ Regression

### 4. **API Architecture** 🔧
- **Endpoints Operational:**
  - `/api/v1/stats/ttest/` ✅
  - `/api/v1/stats/anova/` ✅
  - `/api/v1/stats/correlation/` ✅
  - `/api/v1/stats/regression/` ✅
  - `/api/guardian/check/` ✅
  - `/api/guardian/health/` ✅
