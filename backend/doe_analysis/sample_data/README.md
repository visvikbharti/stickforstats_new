# DOE Data Templates

This directory contains data format templates for Design of Experiments (DOE) analyses. 

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: No sample data is provided. You must upload your own authentic experimental data.**

## Templates

1. `factorial_design_template.csv`
   - Template for factorial design experiments
   - Includes column headers and instructions
   - Must be populated with your real experimental data

## Usage

These templates help you:

1. Understand required data format for DOE analysis
2. Structure your experimental data correctly
3. Ensure proper column naming conventions

**All data must be authentic experimental results from your actual studies.**

## Data Requirements

### General Guidelines
- **Factors**: Experimental variables you control (numeric or categorical)
- **Responses**: Measured outcomes from your experiments (numeric)
- **Data Quality**: All values must represent actual experimental measurements
- **File Format**: CSV with headers in first row

### Supported Design Types
1. **Factorial Designs** - Full or fractional factorial experiments
2. **Response Surface Designs** - Central composite, Box-Behnken designs
3. **Screening Designs** - Plackett-Burman, definitive screening
4. **Custom Designs** - Any structured experimental design

### Required Columns
- At least 1 factor column (your experimental variables)
- At least 1 response column (your measured outcomes)
- Optional: blocks, replicates, run order

**Upload your template through the DOE Analysis module to begin analysis.**
