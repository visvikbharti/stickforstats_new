## Technical Decisions

### 1. Design Generation
We're using a combination of Python libraries (including pyDOE, statsmodels) for generating experimental designs. The DesignGeneratorService provides a unified interface for different types of designs.

### 2. Analysis
The ModelAnalyzerService uses statsmodels for statistical analysis, with custom enhancements for DOE-specific analyses. This allows for flexibility in model specification and interpretation.

### 3. Optimization
We're using scipy's optimization functions along with custom desirability functions for response optimization. This provides a robust solution for single and multiple response optimization.

### 4. Real-time Updates
WebSockets are used for real-time updates during long-running analyses. This improves user experience by providing progress updates and immediate results when analyses complete.

### 5. Reporting
We're using ReportLab for generating PDF reports with statistical results and visualizations. This provides professional-quality reports for sharing results.

## Next Steps

1. Begin frontend implementation for DOE analysis components
2. Create interactive visualizations for design, analysis, and optimization
3. Integrate with the main application
4. Complete documentation and testing
