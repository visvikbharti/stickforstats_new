# SQC Analysis Module Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Model Inconsistency**: Fixed the inconsistency between `EconomicDesign` in models.py and `EconomicDesignAnalysis` in serializers/views:
   - Created a separate `EconomicDesignAnalysis` model in models/economic_design.py
   - Updated the models/__init__.py to properly import and expose both models
   - Maintained `EconomicDesign` for backward compatibility

2. **Process Capability API**: Implemented the missing `create` method in `ProcessCapabilityViewSet`:
   - Added complete implementation for creating a process capability analysis
   - Added data validation, dataset loading, and error handling
   - Implemented the full flow of creating an analysis session, performing the analysis, and storing results

3. **URL Configuration**: Enabled the SQC Analysis API endpoints in the main URLs:
   - Uncommented the SQC Analysis URL inclusion in stickforstats/urls.py

4. **Testing**: Created a comprehensive test script (test_sqc_analysis.py):
   - Includes authentication test
   - Dataset upload for testing
   - Tests for all main API endpoints:
     - Control Chart Analysis
     - Process Capability Analysis
     - Acceptance Sampling Plan
     - Economic Design Analysis
     - SPC Implementation Plan

## Remaining Work

1. **Front-end Integration**: 
   - Implement front-end components that interact with the SQC Analysis API
   - Link the front-end components to the API endpoints

2. **Service Enhancements**:
   - Enhance the process capability service with additional statistical tests
   - Add more visualization options for control charts 
   - Implement additional rules for pattern detection in control charts

3. **Documentation**:
   - Complete the API documentation for all endpoints
   - Add usage examples and tutorials
   - Update the swagger/OpenAPI schema

4. **Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all services
   - Implement integration tests for the entire module
   - Test performance with larger datasets

## Verification

To verify the SQC Analysis module is working correctly:

1. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python test_sqc_analysis.py
   ```

3. Check the console output to verify that all tests have passed
   
4. You can also test the API endpoints manually using tools like Postman or curl
