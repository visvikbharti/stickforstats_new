## ‚úÖ WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### In Results:
- **Precision**: Numbers should show many decimal places (up to 50)
- **Example**: `2.8722813232690143299253057341094646591101322289914`
- **Not**: `2.872` (this would be standard precision)

### Performance:
- Results should appear within 1-2 seconds for most tests
- No errors in the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console)

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If you see "Connection Error":
- Make sure backend is running: `python manage.py runserver 8000`
- Make sure frontend is running: `npm start` (port 3001)

### If results don't show precision:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is updated with latest code
