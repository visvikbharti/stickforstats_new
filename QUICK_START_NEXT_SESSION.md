# Quick Start Guide - Next Session

## 📋 What Happened Last Session

✅ **COMPLETED: SQC Module (6/6 lessons)**
- Lesson 4: Process Capability Analysis (900 lines)
- Lesson 5: Measurement System Analysis (750 lines)
- Lesson 6: Acceptance Sampling (922 lines)
- Total: 2,266 lines added
- Zero compilation errors
- Git commit: `4b673f7`

## 📊 Current Platform Status

**5 Complete Modules | 38 Total Lessons**
1. PCA: 10/10 ✅
2. Confidence Intervals: 8/8 ✅
3. Design of Experiments: 8/8 ✅
4. Probability: 6/6 ✅
5. **SQC: 6/6 ✅ (JUST COMPLETED)**

## ⚠️ Critical Gap

**277KB of SQC backend code EXISTS but is NOT CONNECTED to lessons**

Front-end lessons are educational-only. Backend simulations are unused.

## 🎯 Recommended Next Step

**OPTION 1: Backend Integration** (6-8 hours)

Connect the 6 SQC lessons to Python backend:
- Lesson 4 → Process capability API
- Lesson 5 → Gage R&R simulation
- Lesson 6 → Acceptance sampling calculator
- Lessons 1-3 → WebSocket real-time control charts

**Why This Is Best:**
- Completes existing work (vs starting new)
- Leverages 277KB existing code (high ROI)
- Demonstrates full-stack skills
- Real simulations = 10x user value
- Stronger for resume/portfolio

## 📖 Context Documents Created

1. **SESSION_CONTEXT_2025-10-03.md** (comprehensive context)
   - What was accomplished
   - Current file structure
   - 5 strategic options analyzed
   - Technical details

2. **STRATEGIC_PLAN_NEXT_SESSION.md** (detailed execution plan)
   - ULTRATHINK analysis
   - Phase-by-phase integration plan
   - Timeline estimates
   - Testing strategy

3. **QUICK_START_NEXT_SESSION.md** (this file - tl;dr)

## 🚀 To Start Next Session

### Use This Prompt:

```
Hi! Continuing from our last session where we completed the SQC module
(6/6 lessons, 2,266 lines added, zero errors).

Please read these context files:
1. SESSION_CONTEXT_2025-10-03.md
2. STRATEGIC_PLAN_NEXT_SESSION.md

I want to proceed with OPTION 1 (Backend Integration) to connect our
SQC lessons with the existing 277KB Python backend code.

Please confirm you understand the plan, then start with Phase 1.
```

## 🎓 What You'll Get (After Backend Integration)

**Before:** 6 educational lessons (read-only)
**After:** 6 fully-functional modules (interactive simulations)

- Users can upload their own data
- Real-time control charts with WebSocket
- Dynamic capability calculations via API
- Live Gage R&R studies
- Interactive OC curve generation

**Platform Value:** ⭐⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

**Option 1 (Recommended):** 6-8 hours
- Can split into 2 sessions (5h + 3h)
- Low risk, high reward
- Clear execution path

**Alternative Options:**
- Option 2: New Regression Module (8h)
- Option 3: New ANOVA Module (6h)
- Option 4: User Features (10h)
- Option 5: Testing/QA (4h)
