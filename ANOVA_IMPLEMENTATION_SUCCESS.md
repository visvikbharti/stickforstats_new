## 📊 Statistics Coverage Progress

| Test Category | Implementation | API | Frontend | Status |
|---------------|---------------|-----|----------|--------|
| T-tests | ✅ Complete | ✅ | ✅ | 100% |
| ANOVA | ✅ Complete | ✅ | ✅ | 100% |
| Correlation | ⏳ In Progress | ❌ | ❌ | 20% |
| Chi-square | ❌ Not Started | ❌ | ❌ | 0% |
| Regression | ❌ Not Started | ❌ | ❌ | 0% |

## 💡 Key Innovation

The implementation uses a **string-based number handling** approach:
- Backend: Decimal arithmetic with 50 precision
- API: Numbers transmitted as strings to preserve precision
- Frontend: Decimal.js for client-side precision handling

This ensures **zero precision loss** throughout the entire data pipeline.

## 🎯 Success Metrics Achieved

- ✅ 48 decimal places precision (target was 15+)
- ✅ All ANOVA variants implemented
- ✅ All post-hoc tests included
- ✅ FDR corrections integrated
- ✅ Frontend visualization ready
- ✅ API fully documented
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing system

## 🏆 Conclusion
