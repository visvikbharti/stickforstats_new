# Strategic Overview - StickForStats Development

## ✅ Migration Status: COMPLETE

### Current Working Directory
`~/StickForStats_v1.0_Production/`

This is now your **single source of truth** - no need to return to the old cluttered directory.

## Strategic Development Plan

### v1.0 (Current - Baseline)
**What we have**: 5 working modules, validated statistics
**Status**: Production-ready for basic statistical analysis
**Quality**: Scientifically accurate, 4+ decimal precision

### v1.1-1.5 (Next 6 weeks - Tier 0 Completion)
**Focus**: Publication-ready features
1. **v1.1**: Enhanced Test Recommender with assumption checking
2. **v1.2**: Multiplicity corrections (prevent p-hacking)
3. **v1.3**: Power & sample size calculators
4. **v1.4**: Effect sizes everywhere
5. **v1.5**: Reproducibility bundle

### v2.0 (3 months - Differentiation)
**Focus**: Unique features for publication
- Automated reporting enhancements
- Workflow automation completion
- Basic interpretation engine
- Educational simulators

### v3.0 (6 months - Advanced Analytics)
**Focus**: Sophisticated methods
- Machine learning integration
- Advanced statistical methods
- GPU acceleration (if needed)
- Time series analysis

### v4.0 (1 year - Ecosystem)
**Focus**: Platform expansion
- RAG/AI assistant
- Marketplace
- Enterprise features
- Community plugins

## Critical Documents Location

### Planning & Tracking
- `docs/STICKFORSTATS_VISION_ROADMAP.md` - Complete vision
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` - Task tracking
- `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - 6-week sprint plan
- `docs/REALITY_ASSESSMENT_2025_01_10.md` - Current state analysis

### Future Development
- `docs/FUTURE_FEATURES.md` - Long-term features (RAG, ML, Enterprise, Marketplace)

## Development Principles (Your Requirements)

1. **No assumptions** - Everything validated
2. **No placeholders** - Only working code
3. **No mock data** - Real calculations only
4. **Evidence-based** - Scientific accuracy required
5. **Simple & grounded** - No exaggeration
6. **Real-world purpose** - Actual utility

## What Makes This Migration Strategic

### Clean Separation
- **v1.0**: Only what works (25% of vision)
- **Future**: Planned features documented but not cluttering codebase
- **No confusion**: Clear line between working and planned

### Version Control Strategy
```
v1.x - Core improvements (Tier 0)
v2.x - Differentiation features (Tier 1)
v3.x - Advanced analytics (ML, GPU)
v4.x - Ecosystem (RAG, Marketplace)
```

### Why This Works
1. **Focused development** - Work on one tier at a time
2. **Clean baseline** - Always can return to v1.0
3. **Clear roadmap** - Know exactly what's next
4. **No clutter** - 75% less files to navigate
5. **Scientific integrity** - Only validated features in production

## Key Statistics

### What's Working (v1.0)
- 5 statistical modules ✅
- 26 test definitions ✅
- Data profiler ✅
- Basic frontend ✅
- **Coverage**: 25% of full vision

### What's Planned (v2.0+)
- RAG system (v4.0)
- Machine learning (v3.0)
- Enterprise features (v2.5)
- Marketplace (v4.0)
- **Coverage**: 75% future work

### Code Quality
- **Validation**: All calculations verified against SciPy
- **Accuracy**: 4+ decimal places
- **Testing**: Core modules have test coverage
- **Architecture**: Clean Django/React separation

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Test the migration**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/StickForStats_v1.0_Production
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start v1.1 development**:
   - Open `docs/PRAGMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - Begin Sprint 1: Test Recommender Enhancement
   - Target: Add assumption checking

3. **Track progress**:
   - Update `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` as you complete tasks
   - Create v1.1 when first enhancement is complete
