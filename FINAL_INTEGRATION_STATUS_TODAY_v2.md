# 🎯 WHAT WE DISCOVERED

## Issue Identified
During integration testing, we found that backend URL routing is not configured for the new endpoints:
- Power Analysis endpoints → 404
- Regression endpoints → 404
- Non-Parametric endpoints → 404
- Categorical endpoints → 404
- Missing Data endpoints → 404

## Root Cause
The backend `urls.py` files need to be updated to include all the new API endpoint routes we created.

## Solution Required
Update backend URL configuration to include all new endpoints (estimated: 30 minutes)
