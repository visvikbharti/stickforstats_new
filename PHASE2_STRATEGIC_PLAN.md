## üîß TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Caching Strategy
```python
# Redis caching for repeated calculations
@cache_result(timeout=3600)
def calculate_statistics(data, params):
    # Cache based on data hash + params
```

### 2. Batch Processing
```python
# New endpoint for multiple analyses
POST /api/v1/batch/
{
    "analyses": [
        {"type": "ttest", "params": {...}},
        {"type": "anova", "params": {...}},
        {"type": "regression", "params": {...}}
    ]
}
```

### 3. Async Processing
```python
# For large datasets
POST /api/v1/async/analysis/
Response: {"job_id": "uuid"}

GET /api/v1/async/status/{job_id}
Response: {"status": "processing", "progress": 45}
```
