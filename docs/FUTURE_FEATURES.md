# Future Features Roadmap - StickForStats

## Important Note
These features are **planned but not yet implemented**. They represent the long-term vision for StickForStats. The codebase for these was removed from v1.0 because it was non-functional placeholders.

## Tier 2: Advanced Features (After Core Completion)

### 1. RAG System (AI Assistant)
**Vision**: Intelligent statistical guidance using LLM
**Current State**: Infrastructure exists but non-functional
**Requirements**:
- LangChain integration
- Vector database (Pinecone/Chroma)
- OpenAI/Claude API integration
- Statistical knowledge base

**Implementation Priority**: After Tier 0 & 1 complete
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 months

### 2. Machine Learning Module
**Vision**: ML algorithms for predictive analytics
**Current State**: Not implemented
**Planned Features**:
- Classification algorithms
- Clustering methods
- Neural network basics
- Model evaluation tools
- AutoML capabilities

**Implementation Priority**: Version 3.0
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 months

### 3. Enterprise Features
**Vision**: Business-ready features for organizations
**Current State**: Not implemented
**Planned Features**:
- User authentication & roles
- Team collaboration
- Audit trails
- Data governance
- API rate limiting
- SLA guarantees

**Implementation Priority**: Version 2.5
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 months

### 4. Marketplace
**Vision**: Plugin ecosystem for custom analyses
**Current State**: Not implemented
**Planned Features**:
- Plugin architecture
- Developer API
- Revenue sharing model
- Quality assurance process
- Community contributions

**Implementation Priority**: Version 4.0
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 months

### 5. GPU Statistical Engine
**Vision**: Hardware acceleration for large datasets
**Current State**: Experimental code removed
**Requirements**:
- CUDA/WebGPU support
- Parallel algorithms
- Memory management
- Benchmarking suite

**Implementation Priority**: Version 3.5
**Estimated Effort**: 3 months

### 6. Real-time Collaboration
**Vision**: Multi-user simultaneous analysis
**Current State**: WebRTC code exists but broken
**Requirements**:
- WebSocket infrastructure
- Conflict resolution
- Session management
- Real-time sync

**Implementation Priority**: Version 2.5
**Estimated Effort**: 2 months

### 7. Automated Reporting
**Vision**: One-click publication-ready reports
**Current State**: Basic PDF generation works
**Planned Enhancements**:
- LaTeX integration
- Journal templates
- Automated interpretation
- Multi-format export

**Implementation Priority**: Version 2.0
**Estimated Effort**: 1 month

### 8. Workflow Automation
**Vision**: Reproducible analysis pipelines
**Current State**: 80% navigation complete
**Requirements**:
- Pipeline designer
- Conditional logic
- Scheduling system
- Version control

**Implementation Priority**: Version 2.0
**Estimated Effort**: 2 months

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1 (Current - v1.x)
Focus: Core statistical functionality
- Complete Tier 0 features
- Enhance existing modules
- Ensure scientific accuracy

### Phase 2 (v2.x)
Focus: Productivity features
- Automated reporting
- Workflow automation
- Basic enterprise features

### Phase 3 (v3.x)
Focus: Advanced analytics
- Machine learning
- GPU acceleration
- Advanced statistics

### Phase 4 (v4.x)
Focus: Ecosystem
- Marketplace
- Plugin architecture
- Community features

## Important Reminders

1. **Don't implement these yet** - Focus on Tier 0 first
2. **No placeholders** - When implementing, build real functionality
3. **Validate everything** - Each feature needs scientific validation
4. **User value first** - Only build what users actually need
5. **Clean architecture** - Don't compromise v1.0's cleanliness

## Why These Were Removed from v1.0

- **RAG System**: Empty infrastructure, no actual AI
- **ML Module**: Not even started
- **Enterprise**: Mock authentication only
- **Marketplace**: Database tables only, no logic
- **GPU Engine**: Experimental code that didn't work
- **Collaboration**: Broken WebRTC implementation
- **Automation**: Incomplete workflow logic

These will be added back **only when properly implemented** with full functionality, testing, and validation.
