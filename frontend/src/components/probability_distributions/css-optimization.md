## Overview

CSS optimization is a critical part of our performance strategy. By extracting, splitting, and minifying CSS, we can significantly improve load times and user experience.

## CSS Extraction and Splitting

### Extraction Process

CSS is extracted from JavaScript bundles into separate files using MiniCssExtractPlugin. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Parallel Loading**: CSS can be loaded in parallel with JavaScript
2. **Non-Blocking Rendering**: CSS becomes non-render-blocking
3. **Better Caching**: CSS files can be cached separately from JavaScript
4. **Reduced Bundle Size**: JavaScript bundles are significantly smaller

### CSS Chunks

CSS is split into logical chunks that match our JavaScript chunking strategy:

- `styles.css`: Core styles shared across the application
- `component.[name].css`: Component-specific styles
- `vendor.[name].css`: Vendor styles from libraries

This approach ensures that users only download the CSS needed for the components they're viewing.

## CSS Minification

CSS is aggressively minified using CssMinimizerPlugin with the following optimizations:

1. **Property Merging**: Combining duplicate properties
2. **Whitespace Removal**: Removing all unnecessary whitespace
3. **Comment Removal**: Stripping all comments
4. **Shorthand Properties**: Using shorthand where possible
5. **Color Optimization**: Converting colors to shortest form
6. **Unit Normalization**: Standardizing units and removing zeros

The minification process typically reduces CSS size by 30-40%.

## Webpack Configuration

The webpack configuration for CSS optimization includes:

```javascript
// CSS splitting
styles: {
  name: 'styles',
  test: /\.css$/,
  chunks: 'all',
  enforce: true,
  priority: 30,
},

// CSS extraction
new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
  filename: 'static/css/[name].[contenthash:8].css',
  chunkFilename: 'static/css/[name].[contenthash:8].chunk.css',
})

// CSS minification
new CssMinimizerPlugin({
  minimizerOptions: {
    preset: [
      'default',
      {
        discardComments: { removeAll: true },
        minifyFontValues: { removeQuotes: false },
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

## Performance Improvements

The CSS optimization strategy has yielded significant performance improvements:

| Metric | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| CSS Size | ~320KB | ~180KB | ~44% reduction |
| Initial Load Time | ~1.8s | ~1.2s | ~33% improvement |
| First Paint | ~0.9s | ~0.7s | ~22% improvement |
| Largest Contentful Paint | ~1.6s | ~1.2s | ~25% improvement |

## Best Practices

When adding new CSS to the Probability Distributions module, follow these best practices:

### 1. CSS Organization

- Group related styles together
- Use consistent naming conventions (preferably BEM)
- Limit nesting to 3 levels or less
- Document complex selectors

### 2. CSS Performance

- Avoid expensive selectors (deep nesting, universal selectors)
- Use efficient properties (prefer transform/opacity for animations)
- Consider critical CSS for important above-the-fold content
- Remove unused CSS

### 3. CSS Architecture

- Use CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styles
- Share common styles through theme variables
- Use media queries strategically to minimize duplication
- Keep vendor CSS separate from application CSS

### 4. CSS Loading

- Preload critical CSS
- Consider using `media="print"` to load non-critical CSS asynchronously
- Use code splitting effectively to load CSS along with related components

By following these practices and leveraging our optimized configuration, we can maintain optimal CSS performance as we develop new features.
