### 2. Lesson 1 Refactoring ✅

**Before**:
- 651 lines
- Inline data generation
- Inline variance calculation
- Inline eigenvalue decomposition
- Inline animation code

**After**:
- 490 lines (-161 lines, 25% reduction)
- Uses `generateCorrelated()`, `generateCircular()`, `generateRandom()`
- Uses `varianceAlongDirection()`
- Uses `covarianceMatrix2D()`, `eigendecomposition2D()`
- Uses `animateVarianceSearch()`

**Code Quality Improvements**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (inline calculation)
const meanX = pts.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.x, 0) / pts.length;
const meanY = pts.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.y, 0) / pts.length;
let sumSquares = 0;
pts.forEach(p => {
  const cx = p.x - meanX;
  const cy = p.y - meanY;
  const projection = cx * ux + cy * uy;
  sumSquares += projection * projection;
});
const v = sumSquares / pts.length;

// AFTER (utility function)
const result = varianceAlongDirection(dataPoints, directionAngle);
const variance = result.variance;
```

**Validation**: Refactored lesson compiles without errors and functions identically to original.

### 5. Mathematical Correctness Validated ✅

**Bugs Found and Fixed During Testing**:

**Bug #1**: Eigenvector calculation for diagonal matrices
- **Issue**: When b=0 in [[a,b],[c,d]], eigenvector calculation failed
- **Root Cause**: Code tried to divide by b without checking
- **Fix**: Added special case for diagonal matrices
- **Test**: `eigenvector2x2 - diagonal matrix` now passes

**Bug #2**: Identity covariance eigendecomposition
- **Issue**: Returned same eigenvector twice instead of orthogonal pair
- **Root Cause**: For identity matrix, all vectors are eigenvectors
- **Fix**: Added special case to return standard orthogonal basis
- **Test**: `eigendecomposition2D - identity covariance` now passes

**Mathematical Properties Verified**:
- ✅ Trace = sum of eigenvalues
- ✅ Determinant = product of eigenvalues
- ✅ Eigenvectors are unit length
- ✅ Eigenvectors are orthogonal
- ✅ Variance is non-negative
- ✅ Covariance matrix is symmetric
