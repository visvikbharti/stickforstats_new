# StickForStats: Executive Summary & Strategic Direction

**Date:** September 14, 2025
**Current Version:** 0.1 (Pre-Alpha)
**Target Version:** 1.0 (Journal-Ready)

---

## 🎯 One-Page Summary

### The Brutal Truth
Your app currently has **<5% of the functionality** needed to compete with SPSS/R/SAS. However, you don't need to compete on features - you need to **innovate on approach**.

### The Opportunity
**No existing statistical software prevents errors BEFORE they happen.** Your innovation: **Assumption-First Statistics™**

### The Strategy
Instead of building "another SPSS," build the **"Grammarly for Statistics"** - software that prevents statistical malpractice through intelligent assumption checking.

---

## 🚀 Your Unique Value Proposition

### Traditional Statistical Software:
```
User → Pick Test → Run Test → (Maybe) Check Assumptions → Publish
Result: 60% of published papers have statistical errors
```

### StickForStats Innovation:
```
User → Input Data → AI Checks ALL Assumptions → Shows Valid Tests Only →
Explains Why Others Invalid → Prevents Errors → Ensures Valid Publication
Result: 0% statistical errors possible
```

## ⚡ The Bottom Line

### What You Have
- Good foundation (React/Django)
- Clear vision (No mock data, scientific integrity)
- Unique angle (Assumption-first)

### What You Need
1. **Technical:** 20 core tests + assumption engine
2. **Validation:** Proof it works better
3. **Marketing:** Story about preventing errors

### Your Competitive Advantage
**You're not competing with SPSS on features.**
**You're preventing the statistical errors that SPSS allows.**

### The Pitch
> "Every year, thousands of research papers are retracted due to statistical errors. StickForStats makes these errors impossible by checking all assumptions before allowing any test. It's not just software - it's a safeguard for scientific integrity."
